# javascript-fundamentals

This repo was made for the Javascript Fundamentals module of the Makers bootcamp (week six). The objectives of this module were to:

- Test-drive a simple Javascript program using Node.
- Explain how asynchronous programming is different from synchronous, blocking programming.
- Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.

These objectives were achieved by working through a sequence of exercises and challenges over one week, a full list of which can be found in the original Makers module [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/javascript-fundamentals).
My completed challenge for this week (a JavaScript app which calculates scorecards for ten pin bowling) can be found [here](https://github.com/atcq9876/bowling-challenge-javascript).
