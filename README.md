# javascript-fundamentals

This repo contains my solutions for the Javascript Fundamentals module of the Makers bootcamp (week six). The objectives I achieved during this module include:
- Test-drive a simple Javascript program using Node.
- Explain how asynchronous programming is different from synchronous, blocking programming.
- Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.

My completed end-of-week challenge for this module (a JavaScript app which calculates scorecards for ten pin bowling) can be found [here](https://github.com/atcq9876/bowling-challenge-javascript).
